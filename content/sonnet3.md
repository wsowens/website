Summary: (2/14/2019)

Atoms against Maxwell's machination  
Twenty thousand columns in a table  
To process each bit of information,  
Neither man nor machine is able.

Many smarter men succumb to despair  
to the unsolved problems in our culture  
and infinite paths that lead to nowhere.  
How should this artist etch out his sculpture?

Enter sunshine, always there at my worst  
She lifts my spirit, ends my frustration  
To solve all your problems, you solve one first  
Rows reduce, begin Unification.

So take this as earnest, not as complaint,  
You are my first and favorite constraint.
