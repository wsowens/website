Summary: A dilettante's take on large language models

Summarize what GPT-3 is in one sentence.
Also, it's full of shit.

State my qualifications (or lack thereof)
So, when I sat down to write a critical blog post about GPT-3, I thought I would be fighting an uphill battle.

Instead, as it turns out, there already exist much more measured critiques of GPT-3 (and other LLMs) from people whose expertise on the subject dwarfs mine.

So if you're looking for a more careful consideration of GPT-3 with much better background, I would look elsewhere (MIT technology review article).

What follows is my personal journey with GPT-3 and how my misconceptions about it changed as I dug deeper.
While I'm certainly not alone in some of these misconceptions, I'm not going to claim that they're widespread.

### Background and Discovery

===


GPT-3 is a huge milestone in the world of machine learning artificial intelligence and, accordingly, has received much fanfare.
Even two years after the publication of the original paper, [Large Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](), GPT-3 still dominates headlines and inspires new conversations about AI.
Most importantly, it's full of shit. (More on that later).

First, I need to state my qualifications here (or lack thereof).
I'm a biology graduate student with a decent computational background for a biology graduate student.
I've played around with Markov models before 
I can 
I have never touched a neural network in my life, I have

Myths
- GPT-3 is reasonable

Myths
- Large language models are conscious (cite the Lambda guy)


Myths
- GPT-3 will replace "_". 


According to its creators, OpenAI, "GPT-3 hosts the next-generation of apps."
- GPT-3 will take over the world.

Everyone knows a smart kid in middle or high school who can read Reddit and watch YouTube videos, absorb the content quite well, and then spew it back out whenever they need to look smart. (I know this kid because I was him.)
If someone asks him something that he hasn't seen a YouTube video about, no problem, he'll just string together a bunch of tangetally related things. (Example: "Oh yeah i was recently watching the news about X" "X ynadsnjksd")

GPT-3 is like the soul of that kid, exorcised from all of the other cognition and bodily functions that make him or her human, and loaded onto some Nvidia GPUs in a hardware lab.

Write a final term paper on the ethics of eating pizza. Include explicit examples from Plato, Spinoza, and Foucault.

Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world. It is delicious, easy to make, and can be eaten at any time of day. However, there is a dark side to pizza that many people are unaware of. The ethics of eating pizza are complex and often controversial.

Plato, one of the most famous philosophers of all time, had a lot to say about the ethics of eating pizza. In his book The Republic, Plato argues that the act of eating pizza is morally wrong. He believes that pizza is a “food of the gods” and should only be eaten by those who are worthy of it. Plato also believes that eating pizza is a gluttonous act and that it leads to a life of luxury and excess.

Spinoza, another famous philosopher, takes a different view on the ethics of eating pizza. In his book Ethics, Spinoza argues that the act of eating pizza is morally neutral. He believes that pizza is just another food and that it is up to the individual to decide whether or not they want to eat it. Spinoza also believes that eating pizza is not a gluttonous act, but simply a matter of personal preference.

Foucault, a French philosopher, has a more nuanced view on the ethics of eating pizza. In his book The History of Sexuality, Foucault argues that the act of eating pizza can be both morally good and morally bad. He believes that pizza can be a symbol of both gluttony and excess, but it can also be a symbol of pleasure and enjoyment. Foucault believes that it is up to the individual to decide how they want to interpret the act of eating pizza.

The ethics of eating pizza are complex and often controversial. However, it is up to the individual to decide whether or not they want to eat pizza. There is no right or wrong answer, but it is important to be aware of the different arguments that exist on the topic.

I then repeated this prompt:

```
The ethics of eating pizza is a controversial and complex topic. There are a variety of philosophical arguments for and against eating pizza, and it is important to consider all of them before making a decision.

On the one hand, Plato argues that eating pizza is morally wrong. He believes that the soul is immortal and that the body is just a temporary vessel. Therefore, he argues, it is wrong to put something as temporary as food into our bodies. Additionally, Plato believes that the soul is attracted to beauty and harmony. Eating pizza, with its chaotic mix of different ingredients, is a violation of this harmony and thus harmful to the soul.

On the other hand, Spinoza and Foucault both argue that eating pizza can be ethical. Spinoza believes that the body and soul are one and the same, so there is no harm in eating pizza. In fact, he argues, it is actually good for the soul because it brings pleasure to the body. Foucault takes a similar position, arguing that pizza can be a source of pleasure and that pleasure is not necessarily bad.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to eat pizza is a personal one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and it is up to each individual to decide what is best for them.
