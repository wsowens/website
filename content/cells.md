Summary: On the inherent difficulties of working with mammalian cells

> "Cell culture's a bitch." 

Those are the words of wisdom that Marie-Pierre Gauthier--my first research mentor. and an brilliant one at that--offered in June of 2018, after my cells died for some inexplicable reason. 
At the time, I had just about 3 weeks of tissue culture under my belt.
Now, 3 years on and hundreds of passages, tubes frozen, and transfections later, I'm inclined to agree.

If a computer program crashes, you can try restarting it.
If a molecular biology reaction fails, you might lose precious sample, but there's still a sense in which you can rerun the reaction.
But cell lines die spontaneously and develop new traits out of the blue.
If you run the same assay on your cells two weeks apart, don't be surprised if you get wildly different results.

There is a great deal of hype at the prospect of "engineering biology".
How can we engineer biology when we can't get this most "fundamental unit of biology" to work reliably?

Working under the mentorship of G.R. Anderson ("G") for the past year has sharpened my focus on these issues.
Instead of the toil and frustration pent up in that quote above, G's mantra exudes the Zen-like calm of a cell culture veteran:

> "I don't pretend to know what cells do or might do."

On the surface, these two mantras resemble each other.
However, whereas Marie's quote was a statement about the technical process, G's statement cuts to the heart of cells biology.
Cells are orders upon orders of magnitude more complicated than our most advanced computers and sophisticated reactions.
They're not machines; they're _alive_.

While it would take dozens of blog posts to distill all of G's philosophy into words, I asked them for just one paper that best captures the difficulties of working with cells.
They offered me [_Genetic and transcriptional evolution alters cancer cell line drug response_ (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30089904/), from Ben-David et al.
So, let's dive into this paper, and start to understand just how _fucked_ this field is.
