		<h3>Interests</h3>
		<p>
			My major interest is in molecular biology and molecular genetics. Specifically, I am very interested in the potential applications of these fields. By understanding biology on its most fundamental level, we can manipulate life itself.
			<br>
			After my first summer of research (see below), I realized just how important bioinformatics has become for biology research. I began studying computer science in my first semester at UF, and acquired an interest in that field as well. Especially fascinating to me are its overlaps with biology, namely its relation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life">artificial life</a>.
			<br>
			Nevertheless, my primary passion is still biology.

		<h3>Summer 2017 (April-August)</h3>
		<p>
			Returning to <a href="http://www.bio.fsu.edu/bass/">Bass Laboratories</a> as a Research Assistant, I again worked under the direction of <a href="http://www.bio.fsu.edu/faculty.php?faculty-id=bass">Dr. Hank Bass</a>. I spent much of the first month working on the <a href="http://www.bio.fsu.edu/bass/maizenucleosome/outreach/">Maize-10-Maze</a>-a large outreach event aimed at engaging the public with the world of maize genetics. At the FSU Research Fields, Bass Laboratories created a model of the maize genome, with mutants placed in the maze at positions corresponding to the genes that give rise to their phenotype. By bringing the maize genome to life, the maize-10-maze allowed the general public to literally step through the genome.
			<br><br>
			As the maize-10-maze was finishing, I shifted my focus towards actual research. In the laboratory, I helped with the <i>in silico</i> search for G-quadruplexes, indentifying candidate G4 sequences in both the human and maize genomes. In the process, I tested and implemented a yet-to-be published program developed by a veteran of the software industry. Ultimately, I left the lab with a library of scripts for the manipulation of FASTA and BED files, facilitating the processing of large volumes of genomic data. 
		</p>
		<h3>Summer 2016 (May-August)</h3>
		<p>
			At my first Summer at Bass Laboratories, I worked as a volunteer Research Intern. I helped with undergraduate Savannah Savadel's efforts to track Nucleotide Diphosphate Kinase activity in <i>Zea mays</i> using epifluorescence microscopy. NDPK activity plays an important role in cellular metabolism, and has been shown <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25679041">to interact directly with G-quadruplexes</a>. 
			<br><br>
			Issues (primarily autofluorescence from the maize tissues) hampered the NDPK localization experiments. Autofluorescence, fluorescence from natural, cellular sources, introduces a great amount of noise to microscopy efforts. I assessed UV photobleaching as a means of reducing autofluorescence. I noted a significant reduction in UV autofluorescence after samples were exposed to several hours of UV radiation, though the effects of UV radiation on the signal itself remains unchecked.

		<h3>Vice President of Open Source Club (August 2017-)</h3>
		<p>
			The UF Open Source Club is a club based on promoting and participating in the <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">Open Source Movement</a>. Primarily, we work on collaborative programming projects <a href="https://github.com/ufosc">(see our GitHub for details)</a>.
			My duties as Vice President include:
			<li>Planning/leading General Body Meetings with the Presdient</li>
			<li>Scheduling and Coordinating Club Events</li>
			<li>Discussing and Contributing to Club Projects</li>
		</p>
		<h3>Florida Alternative Breaks (March 2017)</h3>
		<p>
			In lieu of a traditional spring break, my girlfriend and I went on a Florida Alternative Break to Nashville, Tennessee, where we spent 40 hours over the course of a week at a Second Harvest Distribution Center.
		</p>
		<h3>Eagle Scout, Boy Scouts of America (Spring 2009 - May 2016)</h3>
		<p>
			I was involved with scouting from age 6 to age 18. In Troop 44, I served as Patrol Leader, Troop Guide, and Senior Patrol Leader, leading around 50 youth and gaining invaluable life experiences. I went to Philmont Scout Ranch twice, serving as Unit Leader the second time.
			<br>
			For my Eagle Scout Project, I constructed a playground in a local park. The playground was of completely original design, and planning included consultation with a carpenter and the local HOA. Construction was completely with around 25 volunteers over the course a day.

	<h2 id="personal">Personal Interests</h2>
		<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>
			I love just about all genres of music. I will probably put up a dedicated music page later. In the meantime, here's my some of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUQEHI1-asVqE2I5Z66irnHUxq95jpd-f">favorites</a>. (Disclaimer: some of the content is explicit.)
			
			</p>
		<h3>Outdoors</h3>
			<p>
			As an avid outdoorsman, the only thing keeping me from becoming a hermit is my need for a solid Internet connection. I have canoed in the boundary waters of Canada and Minneosta, backpacked in New Mexico, and camped all across the Southeast. Most recently, I spent 10 days this past summer backpacking the entire Great Smokey Mountains National Park with my father and brother.  
			</p>	
		<h3>Science Fiction</h3>
			<p>
				It is probably unsurprising, but I am a massive Science Fiction nerd. Some of my favorite authors include Philip K. Dick, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Neil Stephenson. My top five books would probably include:
				<li><i>The Mote in God's Eye</i> by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle</li>
				<li><i>Contact</i> by Carl Sagan</li>
				<li><i>The Gods Themselves</i> by Isaac Asimov</li>
				<li><i>The Man in the High Castle</i> by Phillip K. Dick</li>
				<li><i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> by Robert A. Heinlein</li>
				<li><i>Snow Crash</i> by Neil Stephenson</li>
				<br>
				I am also a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/">Orions Arm Universe Project</a>. It's a massive collaborative worldbuilding effort, with contributors of all different backgrounds.
				<br><br>
				If you're looking to burn fifteen minutes, here are some of my favorite short stories:
				<li><a href="Documents/lastquestion.pdf">"The Last Question"</a> by Isaac Asimov (I highly, highly recommend this one.)</li>
				<li><a href="http://mith.umd.edu/digitalstorytelling/wp-content/uploads/GibsonW_Burning_Chrome.pdf">"Burning Chrome"</a> by William Gibson</li>
				<li><a href="http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Robert-A.-Heinlein-All-You-Zombies.pdf">"All You Zombies"</a> by Robert A. Heinlein</li>
				<br>
				Science fiction encourages its reader to imagine a future different than their own. I can firmly say much of my outlook is shaped by reading these sorts of novels.
